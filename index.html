        <h3>I'm a Web Developer</h3>
        <p>
          Having grown up with the Web 1.0 I used to work with PHP, SQL and JavaScript in the early days. I joined a small start-up in 2001 which was mainly focused on collecting financial data. I was responsible for visualizing that data in terms of creating self-statement charts, factsheets and simple tools whereby I learned a lot about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSL_Formatting_Objects">XSL-FO</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a> and <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">RaphaÃ«l</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In October 2011 I joined <a href="http://www.uxebu.com/">uxebu</a>, a start-up that lets me work with cutting edge tools, technologies and APIs. I became a JavaScript expert, core contributor of a fantastic graphics library, called <a href="http://bonsaijs.org/">BonsaiJS</a> and a <a href="http://www.pixelplant.com/">Flash whisperer</a>. They support and encourage me attending and speaking at <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/basecode/">conferences</a>.

        <h3>I'm an iOS Developer</h3>
        <p>
          In 2008 I decided to go more low-level and started learning C and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C">Obj-C</a>. Together with <a href="http://www.madamelerenoir.com/">MadameLeRenoir</a>, we created the following <a href="http://itunes.com/madamelerenoir">list</a> of iOS apps so far. Among other APIs I got familiar with <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreGraphics/Reference/CoreGraphics_Framework/_index.html">Core Graphics</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreAnimation_guide/Introduction/Introduction.html">Core Animation</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Test-driven development (TDD)</h3>
        <p>
          I had the chance to learn from one of the best and since then consider untested code as worthless in the log-term. Writing tests makes you sleep better and completely removes those moments of "I'm afraid of touching the code". As a side effect following the rules of TDD will heavily influence the way you code in a good sense.  Since 2012 I offer TDD coaching as part of my job at Uxebu.
